Been a while since I impletemented anything. Thought to get back into track by this very first project that every Machine Learning Enthusiast does.
Dataset was taken from MNIST original website and kaggle's Digit Recognizer competition data was also used.
Accurace: 98+ %.
Anyone who wants to use the code and try different variations of Neural Networks and can get a better accuracy, you are free to do so.
